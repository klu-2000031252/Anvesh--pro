# Travel
Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
A user with a valid system account and a valid travel account logs in to the system, requests to book a flight reservation, selects a flight, selects a payment method, and specifies delivery services for the flight tickets and travel itineraries. The system will accommodate both individual and corporate traveler accounts for domestic and international flight reservation travel requests.

Project Description*:
Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.
